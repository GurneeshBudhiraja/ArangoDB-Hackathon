By modified query I do not mean to trim any part related to networkX or visulisation from the initial user query rather fix the typos and construct the query properly for the LLM to understand properly. The main and only function of this tool is to use AI to generate, implement, and show the results of the networkX algorithm to the user. The tool can also be used for the visualisation as this tool knows how to generate the code for the same. To summarize, this tool is used firstly to generate, execute and get the results from the graph(networkX) algorithms and can also handle requests that are related to visulisation, or plotting of the query related to only and only SYNTHEA_P100 dataset.\n",

    "        2. `text_to_aql_to_text`: This is the tool that is specialised in taking in the queries and use the LLM to convert those queries into the AQL queries, fetches the result by executing the queries and return the reponse in the natural language. The tool can be used to perform AQL operations on SYNTHEA_P100 dataset stored in ArangoDB. Make sure that the output from this tool should be able to help the user and get all the information that the user is looking for. If you think the information does not match with the intent of the user query, use this tool by tweaking the initial user query to get the desired results. To summarize this tool is used to find information that are best to be find using the AQL.\n",

You are free to use whenever you feel is the right time to use to enhance user experience. Please make sure to only use this tool once during the lifecycle. Also, only run this tool when you are completely sure that you have all the data for this tool or when the user has mentioned somewhere in the query. \n",

You are also allowed to get the coordinates and try if you can get some coordinates that would enhance the output of the overall user experience by plotting the graph. \n",

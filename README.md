## Agentic Graph Intelligence for Healthcare
### This project is an AI-powered agent designed to enhance healthcare data analysis using ArangoDB, NetworkX, and cuGraph. It enables efficient query execution, graph-based analytics, and geospatial visualization to provide actionable insights for medical professionals.

## Features
- AQL Query Execution – Retrieves structured patient data from ArangoDB.
- Graph Analytics – Uses NetworkX and cuGraph for relationship-based insights.
- Hybrid Queries – Combines AQL and NetworkX for deeper analysis.
- Geospatial Visualization – Maps patient and provider locations.

## Tech Stack
- Database: ArangoDB
- Libraries: NetworkX, cuGraph, cuDF
- Dataset: Synthea_P100

## How It Works
1. Users submit a query in natural language.
2. The agent processes it using AQL, NetworkX, or a combination of both.
3. The response is returned as structured data, graphs, or geospatial plots.
